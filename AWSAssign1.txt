Q 1 what is cloud ?
Ans - "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all          over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.


Q 2 What is cloud computing ?
Ans -Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing model. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers      and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Q 3 Advantages of cloud.
Ans - 1.Agility
          The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up       resources as you need them–from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much       more.

          You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes, and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before. This gives you the freedom       to experiment, test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences, and transform your business.
          
      2.Elasticity
          With cloud computing, you don’t have to over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the amount             of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down to instantly to grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change. 
      
      3.Cost savings
          The cloud allows you to trade capital expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the             variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale. 
          
      4.Deploy globally in minutes
          With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example, AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy your         application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.     
          
Q 4 Types of cloud computing.
Ans -There  are 3 main types of cloud computing as follows.
      1.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
       IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage        space. IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT          departments and developers are familiar. 
       
      2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
        PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of           your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of           the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. 

      3.Software as a Service (SaaS)
        SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications         (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only           need to think about how you will use that particular software. 

Q 5. What is EC2?
Ans - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing       easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.

Q 6. What is difference between Cloud and Server?
Ans - Expanding storage in the cloud environment does not incur any downtime. Dedicated servers also take more time and resources to change processors without maintenance downtime. Websites hosted on a single server that requires additional processing capabilities require a total migration or networking with another server.

Normal servers, in fact, refers to the regular physical technology you're installing somewhere in the room, while cloud server is perceived as an online system able to store a large amount of data, deliver software services, balance loading time, automate business process and operations, and allow enough customization for the user to make the desired changes. Super heroes, almost. With a normal server in place, such possibilities won't be present.
